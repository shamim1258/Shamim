# MVT

MVT stand for Model View Template.
MVT is generally very similar to that of MVC which is a Model, View, and Controller. The difference between MVC and MVT here is the Django itself does the work done by the controller part in the MVC architecture.
Django does this work of controller by using templates. Precisely, the template file is a mixture of HTML part and Django Template Language also known as DTL.  
The Template handles the UI and architecture part of an application. The view does the logical part of the application and interacts with the Model to get the data and in turn modifies the template accordingly. Here as already mentioned, Django works as a controller and gets a URL that is linked to the view part of the application and thus transports the user responses to the application. This complete interaction is dealt with this Django MVT architecture.

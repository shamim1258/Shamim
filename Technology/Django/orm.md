# ORM
-  ORM stands for Object Relational Model
-  It is layer between Database and python.
-  **Advantages :**
   -  The database engine is abstracted from us, so it is possible to switch to another database system with ease.
   -  It supports migrations: we can easily change our tables by updating our models and Django will automatically generate the migration scripts needed to update the database tables.
   -  It supports transactions: you can make multiple updates to the database within a transaction and, if something fails, roll it back to the way it was when you started.
-  ORM methods
   -  get
      -  It returns object.
      -  It return one and only one object.
      -  Throw exception error if no record found or multiple record found.
   -  filter
      -  It returns queryset object.
      -  It worked even if no record found or multiple record found.

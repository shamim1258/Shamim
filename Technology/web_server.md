# Web Server
-  Web Server is combination of Hardware and Software that stores website files (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files) and delivers it to web browser. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages).
-  Types :
   -  A static web server, or stack, consists of a computer (hardware) with an HTTP server (software). We call it "static" because the server sends its hosted files as-is to your browser.
   -  A dynamic web server consists of a static web server plus extra software, most commonly an application server and a database. We call it "dynamic" because the application server updates the hosted files before sending content to your browser via the HTTP server.

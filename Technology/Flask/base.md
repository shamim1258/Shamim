   -  Watchdog provides a faster, more efficient reloader for the development server.
-  Debug Mode : The flask run command can do more than just start the development server. By enabling debug mode, the server will automatically reload if code changes, and will show an interactive debugger in the browser if an error occurs during a request.
   -  The debugger allows executing arbitrary Python code from the browser. It is protected by a pin, but still represents a major security risk. Do not run the development server or debugger in a production environment.
   -  To enable debug mode, use the --debug option.

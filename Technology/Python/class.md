# Class
- Classes are created by keyword class.
- Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
- Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: ```Myclass.Myattribute```.
- An **Object** is an instance of a Class.

### self
- We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it.

### __init__ method
- __init__ method is similar to constructors used to initializing the object.
- It runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.

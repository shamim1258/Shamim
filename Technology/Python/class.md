# Class
- Classes are created by keyword class.
- Attributes or Properties are the variables that belong to a class.
- Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: ```Myclass.Myattribute```.
- An **Object** is an instance of a Class.
- **__init___** method in class initize the object and takes the first argument `self` which is object of class but we can use anything in place of `self` here.

## Inheritance
-  Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.
-  Advantages :
   -  It represents real-world relationships well.
   -  It provides reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
   -  It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
-  **Parent Class** is called the base class and any class can be a base class.

    class Person:
      def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname
      def printname(self):
        print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

-  **Child Class** is one which inherits from base class.
^
    class Student(Person):
    pass
    --Now the Student class has the same properties and methods as the Person class.
    x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
    x.printname()
    
-  The child class __init__() function overrides the inheritance of the parent class __init__() function and the child class will no longer inherit the parent's __init__() function.
-  **Overriding :** If you add a method in the child class with the same name as a function in the parent class, the inheritance of the parent method will be overridden by child.
-  Class build in function :
   -  `super().<function or variable name>` in the child class used to inherit any given methods and properties from its parent.
   -  'isinstance()' returns True if the object is an instance of the class or other classes derived from it. Each and every class in Python inherits from the base class object.
   -  `issubclass()` return True if class interitance given in input is true.
-  **Method Resolution Order (MRO) :** describes the search path of the class which Python uses to get the appropriate method in classes that contain the multi-inheritance.
  -  `<Class_Name.mro()>` is used to see the method resolution order of a class.
  -  It follows **left(deep) to right** so it will first search first left class than all its super/parent classes than its right class if not searched yet.

### Types of Inheritance
-  **Single inheritance :**
   -  When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called single inheritance.
-  **Multiple inheritance :**
   -  When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
   -  `class child_class(parent_1, parent_2)`
-  **Multilevel inheritance :**
   -  When we have a child and grandchild relationship.

    class BaseClass():
    class ChildClass(BaseClass):
    class GrandChildClass(BaseClass):
-  **Hierarchical inheritance :**
   -  More than one derived classes are created from a single base.
-  **Hybrid inheritance :**
   -  This form combines more than one form of inheritance. Basically, it is a blend of more than one type of inheritance.
### Variable Access and Scope
-  **Private member**
   -  The private member of parent are not accessible to the child class.
   -  Use __ to make a variable private `self.__variable_name = 'value'`

### self
- We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it.

### __init__ method
- __init__ method is similar to constructors used to initializing the object.
- It runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.

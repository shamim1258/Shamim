- It support objects, modules, threads, exception-handling, and **automatic memory management**.
- Python is simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability, is capable of scripting, is completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging modularity and code reuse.
- Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, Rapid Application Development and deployment.

|||||

| S No | Differences | REST | SOAP |
| 1 | Full Form | Representational State Transfer | Simple Object Access Protocol |
| 2 | Design | Architectural design pattern for developing web services | Protocol used to implement web services |
| 3 | Use1 | REST architecture can have SOAP protocol as part of the implementation | SOAP cannot use REST as it is a protocol |
| 4 | Strictly Follow | REST defines standards but they need not be strictly followed | SOAP specifies standards that are meant to be followed strictly |
| 5 | Flexibility | The REST client is more flexible like a browser and does not depend on how the server is developed unless it follows the protocols required for establishing communication | SOAP client is more tightly coupled to the server which is similar to desktop applications having strict contracts |
| 6 | Data Format | XML, JSON, MIME, Text, etc. | only XML |
| 7 | Cache | read requests can be cached | eads are not cacheable |
| 8 | Endpoint | Uses URI to expose the resource logic | uses service interfaces for exposing the resource logic |
| 9 | Speed | Fast | Slow |
| 10 | Security | REST only inherits the security measures based on what protocol it uses for the implementation | SOAP is a protocol, it defines its own security measures |

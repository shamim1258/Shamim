## Python

1.  We have list[0,1,2..9] how we can print this list in reverse order.
&emsp;<details>Use rever method of list list.reverse() this will reverse the list whenever it is referred.

1.  We have list[1,2,3,4] if input number in list is even print square of it and if odd print cube of it, output should be [1,4,27,16].
&emsp;<details>
Use % operator for getting the remainder input % 2 == 0 to get square = num**2 to get cube = num**3
